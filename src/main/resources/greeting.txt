Welcome to PyxleOS!

What's new in this version
------------------------------------

1.Menu items now have Key Bindings!
2.Improved internal window system (still buggy as ever)
3.Bugfix on the color chooser. Hit cancel and it will now stay the same color!
4.Exit prompt (Loosing work is bad, even in an alpha)
5.Started work on Copic Color Palette... slow... heh
6.Changed textEdit default font size from 16 to 17

Made with love and Java,
